How to approach problems for solving pattern problems ?

Lets say you have pattern like this, printing n stars for n lines 

<h3>*<h3>
<h3>* *</h3>
<h3>* * *</h3>
<h3>* * * *</h3> 

You have to print stars âœ¨ according to the number of lines displayed. for e.g. 
in first line print one star, on second line print two stars, likewise for n number of lines print n stars 

Step 1 : The Outer loop will run for N number of lines (As no of lines = no of rows)
	
Step 2 : Identify for every row number <br>
         How many columns are there? 
	
Step 3 : What you have to print ?
