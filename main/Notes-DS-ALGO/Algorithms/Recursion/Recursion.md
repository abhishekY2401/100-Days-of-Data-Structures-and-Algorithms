### How to understand or approach a recursive problem?

1. Identify if you can break down the problem into smaller problems.
2. Write the recurrence relation if needed.
3. Draw the recursive tree.
4. About the tree.

  - <h3>See the flow of functions, how they are getting set in stack</h3>
  - <h3>Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls</h3>
5. See how the function calls are returning and where it is getting called from
